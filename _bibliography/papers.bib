Recycled water is a feasible alternative to alleviate the water shortage, but it is constrained by humans’ perceptions. The current study examines how residents’ water scarcity awareness and climate change belief influence their willingness to use recycled water directly and indirectly. Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics was employed on a dataset of 1831 residents in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an arid inland region in the US. We discovered that residents’ willingness to use direct recycled potable water is positively affected by their awareness of water scarcity, but the effect is conditional on their belief in the impacts of climate change on the water cycle. Meanwhile, the willingness to use indirect recycled potable water is influenced by water scarcity awareness, and the belief in climate change further enhances this effect. These findings implicate that fighting climate change denialism and informing the public of the water scarcity situation in the region can contribute to the effectiveness and sustainability of long-term water conservation and climate change alleviation efforts.}, number={1}, journal={The VMOST Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities}, author={Minh-Hoang Nguyen and Duc Manh Doan and Hanh Kim Dong and Van Thi Nguyen and Hanh Hong Dao and Duy Duc Trinh and Nhai Thi Nguyen and Kim Nguyet Kieu and Nhung Quynh Thi Le and Ha Thu Thi Hoang and Van Ngoc Thi Dam and Dung Hoang Do and Thu Thi Vu and Tu That Ton and Nhi Yen Nguyen and Nhi Van Nguyen and Thu Tai Le and Hoa Tuan Pham and Binh Thi Khuat and Tung Thanh Nguyen and Anh Viet Thuy Nguyen and Vu Thien Tran and Son Kim Thi Nguyen and Tra Thanh Nguyen and Hang Thanh Pham and Linh Ha Nguyen and Hien Thanh Thi Vu and Linh Thu Hoang and Dung Kim Nguyen and Chi Yen Nguyen and Chi Linh Nguyen and Minh Duc Vu and Lan Phuong Thi Le and Van-Cuong Do}, year={2024}, month={Apr.}, pages={62-75} }
